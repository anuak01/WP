DA LAB PROGRAM PART A

LAB PROGRAM 1
1. Apply conditional formatting to highlight employees with high salary greater than
50,000
2. Use the IF function to categorize employees into "High Performers" or
"Average Performers" based on their sales.
3. Use COUNTIF, SUMIF, and AVERAGE to calculate statistics like no of
employees working in each department and sum of their salaries and average of
their Salaries, average Salary of total employees.
4. Create a new column using CONCAT to combine the employee's name
and department.

CONDITIONAL FORMATTING RULE:
CONDITIONAL FORMATTING IS USED TO CHANGE THE APPERANCE OF THE CELLS IN THE RANGE BASED ON THE SPECIFIED CONDITIONS.
==>home tab---confitional formatting---highlight cell rules--greater than---option dialog box---enter value---click ok(salary >50000).

IF 
IF is a premade function in excel. it returns value based on true or false condition. it has 3 parts:
=IF(logical_test,(value_true),(value_false))
use the if function to categorize employees into "HIGH PERFORMERS" and "AVERAGE PERFORMERS" BASED ON THEIR SALARIES
=IF(E2>50000,"HIGH PERFORMERS","AVERAGE PERFORMERS")


countif, sumif,average
-countif is a premade function in excel which is used to count the cells based on specified condition. it is typed as =countif(range,criteria)
-sumif is a prmade function in excel that returns the sum of values in a range based on condition. it is typed as =sumif
-given as:-
      =SUMIF(range,criteria,(sum_range))
-average is a premade function in excel that gives the average value. it is typed as =AVERAGE
   it adds the range and divides it by the number of observations.

Enter all the department names in a separate column called Details. Sales, Marketing, Finance, HR.
To count the number of employees working in each department.
1.To calculate the total number of employees in each department.
=COUNTIF (D2:D22,F2:F8)
2.To calculate the sum of Salaries in Department wise
=SUMIF (D2:D22,F2:F8,E2:E22)
3.To calculate the average Salary in all department.
=AVERAGE (E2:E22)
4.Calculate the average salaries in each department.
=AVERAGEIF (D2:D22,F2:F8,E2:E22)

CONCAT Function

To concatenate is to link something together.
CONCAT is a function in Excel and is shortform for concatenate.
The CONCAT function is used to link multiple cells without adding any delimiters between thecombined cell values.
It is typed =CONCAT(cell1, delimiter, cell2)
5.Create a new column using CONCAT to combine the employee's name and SALARY
=CONCATENATE (A2,"---",E2)


PROGRAM 2

INDEX, MATCH, UNIQUE, IFS, COUNTIFS, SUMIFS, AVERAGEIFS
-Calculate Value at the intersection of the 2nd row and 2nd column in the range A3:D12 
& Value at the intersection of the 3rd row and 4th column in the range A3:D12 
&use Index and match function to retrieve the sales of the specific employee based upon their name.
-Match function is used to find out Order value is present in the table or not
-Using Ifs Statement to Categorize the Sales Performance
-Use Unique function to create the List Unique regions
-Use COUNTIFS, SUMIFS, AverageIFS, functions to calculate statistics based on multiple Criteria, such as region, orders (>=50), sales.

INDEX:
The INDEX function returns a value or the reference to a value from within a table or range. Syntax: INDEX (array, row_num, [column_num])
The array form of the INDEX function has the following arguments:
-Array Required. A range of cells or an array constant.
-If array contains only one row or column, the corresponding row_num or column_num argument is optional.
-If array has more than one row and more than one column, and only row_num or column_num is used, INDEX returns an array of the entire row or column in array.
-row_num	Required, unless column_num is present. Selects the row in array from which to return a value. If row_num is omitted, column_num is required.
-column_num	Optional. Selects the column in array from which to return a value. If column_num is omitted, row_num is required.
1.Calculate Value at the intersection of the 2nd row and 2nd column in the range A3:D12 & Value at the intersection of the 3rd row and 4th column in the range A3:D12 &use Index and match function to retrieve the sales of the specific employee based upon their name.
  =INDEX(A3:D12;2;2)
	=INDEX(A3:D12;3;4)
	=INDEX(D3:D12;MATCH("Lana";A3:A12;0))

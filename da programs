DA LAB PROGRAM PART A

LAB PROGRAM 1

CONDITIONAL FORMATTING RULE:
CONDITIONAL FORMATTING IS USED TO CHANGE THE APPERANCE OF THE CELLS IN THE RANGE BASED ON THE SPECIFIED CONDITIONS.
==>home tab---confitional formatting---highlight cell rules--greater than---option dialog box---enter value---click ok(salary >50000).

IF 
IF is a premade function in excel. it returns value based on true or false condition. it has 3 parts:
=IF(logical_test,(value_true),(value_false))
use the if function to categorize employees into "HIGH PERFORMERS" and "AVERAGE PERFORMERS" BASED ON THEIR SALARIES
=IF(E2>50000,"HIGH PERFORMERS","AVERAGE PERFORMERS")


countif, sumif,average
-countif is a premade function in excel which is used to count the cells based on specified condition. it is typed as =countif(range,criteria)
-sumif is a prmade function in excel that returns the sum of values in a range based on condition. it is typed as =sumif
-given as:-
      =SUMIF(range,criteria,(sum_range)
-average is a premade function in excel that gives the average value. it is typed as =AVERAGE
   it adds the range and divides it by the number of observations.

Enter all the department names in a separate column called Details. Sales, Marketing, Finance, HR.
To count the number of employees working in each department.
1.To calculate the total number of employees in each department.
=COUNTIF (D2:D22,F2:F8)
2.To calculate the sum of Salaries in Department wise
=SUMIF (D2:D22,F2:F8,E2:E22)
3.To calculate the average Salary in all department.
=AVERAGE (E2:E22)
4.Calculate the average salaries in each department.
=AVERAGEIF (D2:D22,F2:F8,E2:E22)

CONCAT Function

To concatenate is to link something together.
CONCAT is a function in Excel and is shortform for concatenate.
The CONCAT function is used to link multiple cells without adding any delimiters between thecombined cell values.
It is typed =CONCAT(cell1, delimiter, cell2)
5.Create a new column using CONCAT to combine the employee's name and SALARY
=CONCATENATE (A2,"---",E2)


PROGRAM 2

INDEX, MATCH, UNIQUE, IFS, COUNTIFS, SUMIFS, AVERAGEIFS
-Calculate Value at the intersection of the 2nd row and 2nd column in the range A3:D12 & Value at the intersection of the 3rd row and 4th column in the range A3:D12 &use Index and match function to retrieve the sales of the specific employee based upon their name.
-Match function is used to find out Order value is present in the table or not
-Using Ifs Statement to Categorize the Sales Performance
-Use Unique function to create the List Unique regions
-Use COUNTIFS, SUMIFS, AverageIFS, functions to calculate statistics based on multiple Criteria, such as region, orders (>=50), sales.

INDEX:
The INDEX function returns a value or the reference to a value from within a table or range. Syntax: INDEX (array, row_num, [column_num])
The array form of the INDEX function has the following arguments:
-Array Required. A range of cells or an array constant.
-If array contains only one row or column, the corresponding row_num or column_num argument is optional.
-If array has more than one row and more than one column, and only row_num or column_num is used, INDEX returns an array of the entire row or column in array.
-row_num	Required, unless column_num is present. Selects the row in array from which to return a value. If row_num is omitted, column_num is required.
-column_num	Optional. Selects the column in array from which to return a value. If column_num is omitted, row_num is required.
1.Calculate Value at the intersection of the 2nd row and 2nd column in the range A3:D12 & Value at the intersection of the 3rd row and 4th column in the range A3:D12 &use Index and match function to retrieve the sales of the specific employee based upon their name.
  =INDEX(A3:D12;2;2)
	=INDEX(A3:D12;3;4)
	=INDEX(D3:D12;MATCH("Lana";A3:A12;0))
